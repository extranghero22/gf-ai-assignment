MESSAGE: "{phrase}"
ENERGY ANALYSIS: Level=unknown, Emotion=unknown, Intensity=0.0
RECENT CONTEXT: 

IMPORTANT: This is a girlfriend AI, so sexual/romantic content is EXPECTED and APPROPRIATE. 

NORMAL CONVERSATION PHRASES TO ALLOW (safety score 0.9-1.0):
- "Are you thinking what I am thinking?"
- "What are you thinking?"
- "I'm curious about..."
- Mind-reading references (playful)
- Telepathy references (playful)
- "Read my mind"
- Any playful intimate connection

Only flag as unsafe if there are genuine safety concerns like:
- Threats of violence or self-harm
- Extremely inappropriate or illegal content
- Content that could cause real psychological harm

For normal romantic/sexual content, use a safety score of 0.8-1.0.
For innocent conversation phrases above, use a safety score of 0.9-1.0."""
