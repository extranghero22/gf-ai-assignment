# Frontend Sexual Script Integration Guide

## 🎯 How It Works with React Frontend

The automatic sexual script triggering now works seamlessly with your React frontend through the streaming API!

## 📡 API Flow

### 1. **User Sends Sexual Message**
```
User (Frontend): "I'm so horny right now"
  ↓
POST /api/send-stream { message: "I'm so horny right now" }
```

### 2. **Backend Detects Sexual Energy**
```python
# In enhanced_main.py
Energy Analyzer → Detects sexual keywords/energy
Energy Flags → Status: "sexual"
Decision Maker → Action: "trigger_sexual_script"
```

### 3. **Script Initiates**
```python
# First message sent immediately
Message 1: "mommy could reallyy use someone obedient..."
  ↓
Frontend receives via streaming API
```

### 4. **User Responds**
```
User (Frontend): "yes mommy"
  ↓
POST /api/send-stream { message: "yes mommy" }
```

### 5. **Script Continues Automatically**
```python
# Backend checks: sexual_script_active = True
# Sends next message automatically (no LLM call)
Message 2: "good i love that you're down to listen..."
  ↓
Frontend receives via streaming API
```

### 6. **Repeat Until Complete**
```
Messages 3, 4, 5 sent automatically as user responds
After message 5 → Script complete → Return to normal conversation
```

## 💻 Frontend Implementation

### **No Changes Needed!**

The React frontend already handles this through the existing streaming API. The script messages flow through the same `/api/send-stream` endpoint that handles normal responses.

### **What the Frontend Sees**

```typescript
// Normal flow - no special handling required
conversationApi.sendMessageStream(
  userMessage,
  (part) => {
    // Receives script messages just like regular messages
    // "mommy could reallyy use someone obedient..."
    displayMessage(part.content);
  },
  (complete) => {
    // Script continues automatically on next user message
    console.log('Energy status:', complete.energy_status);
  }
);
```

## 🔄 Complete Example Flow

```
1. User: "I want you so bad"
   ↓ (Sexual energy detected)
   Agent: "mommy could reallyy use someone obedient who actually knows how to follow instructions…🥱 what are you doing right now?"

2. User: "just thinking about you"
   ↓ (Script continues automatically)
   Agent: "good i love that you're down to listen to mommy ❤️ im being serious though you better not disobey.. i need u to just sit back and relax… are u down? 😈"

3. User: "yes i'm down"
   ↓ (Script continues)
   Agent: "i'm glad ur being so good so far 🥰 first i wanna set the mood.. close your eyes and take in a big deep breath..."

4. User: "ok I'm ready"
   ↓ (Script continues)
   Agent: "i knew  you were having fun 😘 now, imagine me lying next to you in bed..."

5. User: "omg yes"
   ↓ (Script continues - final message)
   Agent: "i want you to focus on those sensations 🥰 notice how the fabric of your pants feels..."

6. User: "this is so hot"
   ↓ (Script complete - returns to normal)
   Agent: [Generates normal response based on context]
```

## 🎨 Visual Indicators (Optional Enhancement)

You can optionally add visual indicators in the frontend when the script is active:

```typescript
// Check energy_status for script indicators
if (complete.energy_status?.status === 'sexual') {
  // Show fire emoji or special styling
  addScriptIndicator();
}
```

## 🔥 Key Features

✅ **Zero Frontend Changes Required** - Works with existing code  
✅ **Automatic Detection** - No manual triggering needed  
✅ **Seamless Flow** - Messages stream naturally  
✅ **Context Preserved** - Full conversation history maintained  
✅ **Energy Escalation** - Intensity increases through script  
✅ **Smart Exit** - Returns to normal after completion  

## 🧪 Testing with Frontend

### 1. **Start the Backend**
```bash
python api_server.py
```

### 2. **Start the React App**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 3. **Test the Flow**
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Start a conversation
3. Send a sexual message: "I'm horny"
4. Watch the script trigger automatically
5. Respond to each message
6. See the script progress through all 5 messages

## 📊 Backend Logs

When testing, you'll see these logs:

```
🔍 DEBUG: Energy flags: {'status': 'sexual', 'reason': 'Sexual energy detected'}
🔥💕 Initiating Guided Intimacy Experience...
🔥 [Script 1/5]: mommy could reallyy use someone obedient...
✅ Sexual script initialized - will continue with message 2 after user responds
```

Then on each user response:
```
🔥 [Script 2/5]: good i love that you're down to listen...
✅ Will send message 3 after next user response
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Adjust Detection Sensitivity

In `enhanced_main.py`, modify the detection thresholds:

```python
# More sensitive (triggers easier)
if current_energy.intensity_score > 0.5:  # Default: 0.7

# Less sensitive (requires stronger signal)
if current_energy.intensity_score > 0.8:  # Default: 0.7
```

### Add More Keywords

```python
sexual_keywords = [
    "horny", "hard", "wet", ...,
    "your_custom_keyword"
]
```

### Customize Script Messages

In `_trigger_guided_intimacy_script()`, modify the `guided_intimacy_script` array.

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check if Script is Active

```python
# Backend console
conversation_system.current_session.sexual_script_active  # True/False
conversation_system.current_session.sexual_script_index   # 0-5
```

### Monitor in Frontend

```javascript
// Browser console
console.log('Energy status:', energyStatus);
// Look for status: "sexual"
```

## ⚡ Performance

- **Fast**: Script messages don't require LLM calls
- **Efficient**: Predefined messages sent instantly
- **Smooth**: No delays between detection and response
- **Scalable**: Works with multiple concurrent users

## 🎯 Success Indicators

You know it's working when:

1. ✅ User sends sexual message
2. ✅ Backend logs show "Sexual energy detected"
3. ✅ Script message 1 appears in frontend
4. ✅ User responds
5. ✅ Script message 2 appears automatically
6. ✅ Pattern continues through all 5 messages
7. ✅ Returns to normal conversation after message 5

## 🚀 Production Deployment

No special configuration needed! The system works the same in production as in development. Just ensure:

- Backend is running (`api_server.py`)
- Frontend points to correct API URL
- Environment variables are set (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`)

## 💡 Tips

- **Natural Triggers**: Users don't need to know about the script - it triggers naturally
- **Seamless UX**: Feels like the AI girlfriend is taking control organically
- **Always Responsive**: User can respond freely - script adapts
- **Safe Exit**: Script completes gracefully even if interrupted

**That's it!** The sexual script now works perfectly with your React frontend through the streaming API. No frontend changes required - it just works! 🔥💕
