# 🔧 Grouped Messages Fix

## Problem

When grouped messages were sent from the backend, only the **last message** in the group appeared in the frontend.

### Example:
```python
# Backend adds TWO messages to context:
["okkkii i went to the store today...", "can i tell you more?"]

# But frontend only received:
"can i tell you more?"  ❌
```

---

## Root Cause

The API server (`api_server.py`) was only retrieving the **last message** from the context:

```python
# OLD CODE (line 190):
last_message = conversation_system.current_session.context.messages[-1]
```

This worked fine for single messages, but failed for grouped messages because:
1. Backend adds multiple messages to context (as separate entries)
2. API only grabbed the last one
3. First messages in the group were ignored

---

## Solution

Updated the API server to **collect all consecutive agent messages** that were just added:

### New Logic:

1. **Traverse backwards** from the end of the message list
2. **Collect all agent messages** that are consecutive
3. **Stop** when hitting a user message
4. **Check for metadata** (`group_part` or `script_message`) to identify grouped messages
5. **Send all collected messages** to frontend

### Code Changes:

**File: `api_server.py`**

```python
# NEW CODE - Collects grouped messages
agent_messages = []
for msg in reversed(conversation_system.current_session.context.messages):
    if msg.get('role') == 'agent':
        if 'group_part' in msg or 'script_message' in msg:
            agent_messages.insert(0, msg)  # Keep in order
            continue  # Keep collecting
        else:
            agent_messages.insert(0, msg)
            break
    else:
        break  # Hit user message, stop

# Send all collected messages
for agent_msg in agent_messages:
    full_response = agent_msg.get('content', '')
    # ... send to frontend
```

**File: `enhanced_main.py`**

Fixed initialization to handle grouped first messages:

```python
# Handle both single and grouped first messages
first_message_item = casual_story_script[0]
messages_to_send = [first_message_item] if isinstance(first_message_item, str) else first_message_item

# Send all messages in the first group
for i, msg in enumerate(messages_to_send):
    # Add to context with group_part metadata
    ...
```

## How It Works Now

### Example: Grouped Messages 4-5

**Backend:**
```python
[
    "okkkii i went to the store today. There is this bottle of soda...",
    "can i tell you more?"
]
```

**Context after processing:**
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I promise"},
    {"role": "agent", "content": "okkkii i went...", "group_part": 0, "script_message": True},
    {"role": "agent", "content": "can i tell you more?", "group_part": 1, "script_message": True}
]
```

**API collects:**
```python
# Starts from end, goes backwards
# Finds: "can i tell you more?" (has group_part ✓)
# Finds: "okkkii i went..." (has group_part ✓)
# Hits: "I promise" (user message, stop)

# Returns both in correct order:
agent_messages = [
    "okkkii i went...",
    "can i tell you more?"
]
```

**Frontend receives:**
```
Message 1: "okkkii i went to the store today. There is this bottle of soda..."
Message 2: "can i tell you more?"
```

✅ Both messages appear!

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Grouped Messages 4-5
```
User: "I promise"
AI:   "okkkii i went to the store today. There is this bottle of soda that i really want to try"
      "can i tell you more?"
```

### Test Case 2: Grouped Messages 7-10
```
User: "yes tell me"
AI:   "but here's the thing... it was kinda expensive for just a drink you know?"
      "so i stood there for like 5 minutes just staring at it trying to decide lmao"
      "and then this old lady walked by and she was like 'oh honey just get it, treat yourself'"
      "so i did! i bought it! and omg baby it was SO GOOD like literally the best decision ever"
```

## Backend Logs

### Before Fix:
```
💬 [Casual Script Part 1/2]: okkkii i went to the store today. There is this bo...
💬 [Casual Script Part 2/2]: can i tell you more?
✅ Will send message 5 after next user response

🔵 Sending response to frontend: can i tell you more?...  ❌ Only last one!
```

### After Fix:
```
💬 [Casual Script Part 1/2]: okkkii i went to the store today. There is this bo...
💬 [Casual Script Part 2/2]: can i tell you more?
✅ Will send message 5 after next user response

🔵 Found 2 agent message(s) to send
🔵 Sending message 1/2: okkkii i went to the store today...  ✅ First one!
🔵 Sending message 2/2: can i tell you more?...              ✅ Second one!
```

## Files Modified

1. **`api_server.py`**
   - Modified `generate_stream()` function
   - Added grouped message collection logic
   - Sends all consecutive agent messages

2. **`enhanced_main.py`**
   - Fixed `_trigger_casual_story_script()` 
   - Now handles grouped first messages
   - Adds `group_part` metadata to all grouped messages

---

## Benefits

✅ **Grouped messages work correctly**  
✅ **All messages in a group appear in frontend**  
✅ **Maintains correct order**  
✅ **Works for any number of grouped messages**  
✅ **Backward compatible** (single messages still work)  

---

## Summary

The fix ensures that when the backend sends grouped messages, the API server correctly identifies and sends **all messages in the group** to the frontend, not just the last one. This creates the natural story flow intended by the grouped message feature.

**Problem:** Only last message sent ❌  
**Solution:** All grouped messages sent ✅
