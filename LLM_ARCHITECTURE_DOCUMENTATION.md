- Energy responses: adapts tone, pace, and approach based on user energy

**Integration Points**:
- Receives energy signatures from Energy Analyzer
- Gets safety status from Safety Monitor
- Uses conversation context for response generation
- Feeds responses back to the system

### 5. **Script Manager LLM** (`enhanced_script_manager.py`)
**Purpose**: Manages structured conversation scenarios and scripted interactions

**LLM Models Used**:
- Scenario-based content (pre-defined scripts)
- Energy-aware message adaptation

**Functionality**:
- Manages 6 different conversation scenarios:
  - **Shopping Scenario**: Casual story sharing
  - **Low Energy Scenario**: Gentle support for tired users
  - **Crisis Scenario**: Crisis support and intervention
  - **Intimate Scenario**: Deep emotional connection
  - **Room Intimacy Scenario**: Private sexual experience (10 messages)
  - **Exhibitionism Scenario**: Public sexual experience (10 messages)

**Key Features**:
- Trigger word matching for scenario activation
- Energy-based scenario selection
- Message adaptation based on user energy
- Success criteria tracking
- Fallback scenario options

**Integration Points**:
- Triggered by energy flags from Energy Analyzer
- Provides structured content to Girlfriend Agent
- Adapts messages based on energy signatures
